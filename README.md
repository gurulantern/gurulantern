### Latest Projects
#### Sub Finder App - 2022
* With a team of other faculty members, I helped to create a possible solution for organizing substitute opportunities in an equitable manner.
* I learned the Slack API and how to create an app for everyone in the Slack workspace to use. The feautures I built included:
    * A form to update itself based on choices and take data from a submission event.
    * Using node-schedule to set times for the app to do certain jobs.
    * Adding a way for the app to interact with Google Sheets and populate the sheets with data with every request made and resolved. 
#### Synthesis Docusaurus Migration - 2022
* Learned MDX in order to help migrate a Faculty handbook from Notion into a Docusaurus site. MDX helped with the following problems:
    * Creating a JSX element to replicate an arrow toggle button.
    * Adding KaTeX for Math equation formatting in the markdown file. 
#### Stone Age Prototype Game - 2022
* Learned C# and Unity 2D to create a possible prototype for a game to be played in Synthesis style. 
* Learned how to use the Colyseus multiplayer framework to manage multiplayer gameplay. Challenges I overcame in this process included:
   * Reading TypeScript and C# code to learn how to use Colyseus despite a low amount of documentation and tutorials. 
   * Updating state for all players along with the different ways for players to update the state. The state of the game included:
     * Animations
     * Multiple scores
     * Building/placing objects
     * Taking objects
   * Hosting a WebGL game on the Arena server while bypassing two large bugs in the Unity WebGL builder and the Colyseus WebGL build.
