### Latest Projects

#### CoLab - Polyphemus Game - 2024
* Based on the tale of Polyphemus in the Odyssey, players play as greek soldiers looking for treasure and sheep in the caves of the cyclops.
* Players must pass the turn to move and keep away from the cyclops or else lose their score.
* Web traps can catch players preventing their move and requiring another player to come and untangle them.
* If at the end of the game, all players have sheep, the team will unlock a secret level where they can grab more treasure.

#### CoLab - Abu Simbel Game - 2024
* Multiplayer card game focused on dismantling, transporting, and rebuilding temples
* Each card comes with a cost to their overall budget. With a budget surplus, they can buy upgrades in between rounds and upgrade the effectiveness of their cards.
* Saving temples earns a positive score and rebuilding them adds a bonus score.
* Every round, players watch as the Nile valley slowly floods and eats temples they were not able to save. 
  
#### HubSpot Automation Project - 2023
* Worked in a coding pair to make an app on Google AppsScript to interact with Hubspot and Slack API to email students after querying for relevant data on students.
  
#### Sub Finder App - 2022
* With a team of other faculty members, I helped to create a possible solution for organizing substitute opportunities in an equitable manner.
* I learned the Slack API and how to create an app for everyone in the Slack workspace to use. The feautures I built included:
    * A form to update itself based on choices and take data from a submission event.
    * Using node-schedule to set times for the app to do certain jobs.
    * Adding a way for the app to interact with Google Sheets and populate the sheets with data with every request made and resolved. 

#### Stone Age Prototype Game - 2022
* Learned C# and Unity 2D to create a possible prototype for a game to be played in Synthesis style. 
* Learned how to use the Colyseus multiplayer framework to manage multiplayer gameplay. Challenges I overcame in this process included:
   * Reading TypeScript and C# code to learn how to use Colyseus despite a low amount of documentation and tutorials. 
   * Updating state for all players along with the different ways for players to update the state. The state of the game included:
     * Animations
     * Multiple scores
     * Building/placing objects
     * Taking objects
   * Hosting a WebGL game on the Arena server while bypassing two large bugs in the Unity WebGL builder and the Colyseus WebGL build.
